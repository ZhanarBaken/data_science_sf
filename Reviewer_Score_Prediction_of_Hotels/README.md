Letâ€™s say that we work as a data scientist at Booking. One of the problems of the company is the dishonest hotels that twist their ratings. One way to detect such hotels is to build a model that predicts the rating of the hotel. If the predictions of the model differ greatly from the actual result, then perhaps the hotel is being dishonest and worth checking out. 

# <p style="border:3px solid DodgerBlue;text-align:center;font-size:100%;">Let's look at the data. </p>
